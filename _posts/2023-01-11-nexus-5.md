So I finally have a phone... That always fails the connection test. I brought it to school today to see if there would be any diffrence, but there wasn't a diffrence.
## 7:00 AM
- Checked on the connection test that has been going on for a day, nothing.
## 8:00 AM
- Took it with me to school
## 9:00 AM
- Reset the phone via Recovery Mode
- Fails the connection test officially

- Preformed more resets and cache partition wiping

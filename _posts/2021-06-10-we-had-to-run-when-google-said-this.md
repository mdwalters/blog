title: Why did Google think of a Chromdroid?
teaser: As I am writing this on a Chromebook, with Android Pie, we still have this question, five years later.

Weall love the internet, it helps to keep connected in these times, but let’s say, you bought a Chromebook or installed CloudReady, it’ll rely on your internet connection. And guess what? You need a connection to set both of these up! Everyone has internet but for these devices, it’ll be crying for the internet. However, Chromebooks have a special capability, using Google Docs, Slides and Sheets… offline. Great, huh? Well, what about anything else? Netflix? You thought right! But, except for doing the Google Docs suite offline, Chromebooks come built-in with ChromeOS and Android! You must be wondering, how did they mash up ChromeOS and Android? It was all quick from a software update. And why do you have the feeling this is going to be a long one? Because for those who are hungry for this information, I’ll be doing hard research on why and how they made ChromeOS with Android capabilities, meaning that you can install your favourite Android apps from the Play Store. In a The Verge article in 2015, when they started the merge they said:

> The Wall Street Journal reports that Chrome is essentially being folded into Android because Android has emerged as the dominant operating system by quite a long stretch. Combining the two operating systems means setting up Android to run on laptops and desktop computers, which would require big changes and support the Google Play Store.

The merge happened back in 2017. They also said:

> It’s easy to see how Google got here. Sundar Pichai, who’s now leading Google, was put in charge of both Chrome and Android two years ago, and he’s made moves to bring the two operating systems closer in that time.

This change drew journalists to write more about this, Jack Wallen, writing to TechRepublic says:

> Over the weekend, some rather interesting news spread about the inter-verse. That news was of Google OS’s demise. That’s right…it was heard ‘round the world by nearly every news outlet I could find. Funny thing about that bit ‘o news…I couldn’t verify a single claim. And so, I reached out to Hiroshi Lockheimer, SVP of Chrome OS, to find out some truth.

The notebook by HP runs Android 4.3, or Jelly Bean, for all of the candy lovers. I got my hands [on an Amazon link to the “Half-tablet”.](https://www.amazon.com/HP-Slatebook-14-Inch-Touchscreen-Android/dp/B00KB3K6G4) It’s out of stock at the moment, and, what Jack Wallen says, will never be in stock. Jack Wallen, in a different article in TechRepublic, writes:

> Lately, I’ve been giving this question quite a bit of thought. I depend on both Chrome OS and Android. I use them throughout every day and would find my process a bit more challenging without them. When it was first announced that Chrome OS would be able to run Android apps, my initial thoughts were positive; I considered this move by Google to be the most logical step forward. It was clearly the best way to compete with the Microsoft Surface and to bring more users into the fold.

We have another problem on our hands.

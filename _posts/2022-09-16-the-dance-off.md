It was recess time, and as always, I went to sit on the college campus like benches, when I thought the benches were boring, so I walked to the field.



I then saw a dance off, wasn't the first one I've seen, mind you, and this time, instead of a JBL speaker, they brought in a BIG SPEAKER THAT MADE ME VIBRATE ALL OVER.



I joined in the circle, and some space was made, and it got a little claustrophobic, and there was dust **everywhere**, so the dust made a exciting view, I guess?




To be honest, the song was good, but the bass? It could shake the ground (and yes, this is me over-exaggerating).



Thwn, recess was over, and we all went inside. The end.

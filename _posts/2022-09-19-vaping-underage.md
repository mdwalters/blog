Well, it's one of those school crazy school adventures again, one of my classmates, vape. No, I'm not assuming this, I him vape saw with my own eyes.



Coincidentally, anything crazy that happens, always occurs at recess. Is recess the cursed period for crazy stuff to happen? Yes.


So, let's start from the beginning. It was time to go out for recess, and as always, I was walking around, because I have no friends. 



I then saw a crowd formed in a circle, knowing from my past trauma, crowds formed in a circle only means one thing: Another dance off. I was begging for it to not be a dance off, luckily, it wasn't



Relived, I walked away from the crowd to continue walking around. I then saw a classmate around two girls, then, he vaped. I couldn't believe what I saw. Someone under the age of 19, vaping.



But, the story goes back a litle bit further to math class. The vaper's table was behind me, and the all girls table was in front, and, you guessed it, I was in the middle with one other student.



The vaper walked to the girls' table, and puffed out smoke. The teacher wasn't in the classroom, mind you. And the girls repeatdly asked what was.



Then, he did it one more time, then stopped. Which leads us to here.

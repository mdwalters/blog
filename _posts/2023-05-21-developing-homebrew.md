Hi. It's been a long time since I've last posted here. I've done multiple things in my break, such as developing an addiction the the rhythm game, osu!, and porting it to the Wii. The GitHub repo for it is [here](https://github.com/mdwalters/osu-wii), but it's in it's alpha stages right now, and can't even play beatmaps yet.




I have also been working on a C++ port of it, which is going... Not so good.

Anyway, aside from that, I'm also getting better at osu! now. However, I blame the lag on my Chromebook for why I can't get any better.

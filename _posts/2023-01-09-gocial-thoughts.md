While I was away, I had a few ideas for Gocial.

## Porting to Python and and including a API
As what **[@oofy123](https://github.com/oofy123)** wanted, I'm planning on porting Gocial from TypeScript to Python. I could create a DB wrapper for [simple-json-db](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-json-db) so we can use the existing DB with ease.



We started from JavaScript, to TypeScript, and now to TypeScript. Should be easy.




I'm also going to drop WebSockets in Gocial in favor for a API. APIs rule!
## Using communities instead of a home screen
Gocial is now officially a Reddit rip-off!

I'm currently waiting for approval from **[@oofy123](https://github.com/oofy123)** on the communities and API idea. I know the Python port would be approved, but you can never be so sure. If you have any ideas, please comment them here.

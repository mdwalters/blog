While I was away, I had a few ideas for Gocial.

## Porting to Python and and including a API
As what **[@oofy123](https://github.com/oofy123)** wanted, I'm planning on porting Gocial from TypeScript to Python. We started from JavaScript, to TypeScript, and now to TypeScript. Should be easy. We do need to port it from a JSON DB, which is insecure. I'm also going to drop WebSockets in Gocial in favor for a REST API. Trying to do it today just gave me more problems. Fun.
## Using communities instead of a home screen
So you know group chats? How about we make those group chats public to everyone? That's where communities come in! It also has a simalar idea to subreddits.

I'm currently waiting for approval from **[@oofy123](https://github.com/oofy123)** on the communities and API idea. I know the Python port would be approved, but you can never be so sure. If you have any ideas, please comment them here.

The new design is sleek, and black, with all of the icons moved around… Time to get to a hands-on!

## New theme
Its background is black, and so is the bottom bar. The top right bar had been replaced. Its new main colour is blue

## Say goodbye to Chat, Hello In-Call Messages!
It’s actually the same thing but with a new name

## What if I hate the design, and want to go back?
Don’t worry. Its days are numbered. Google will remove the option to go back tomorrow, which, for those of you reading this in the future for nostalgia, the date Google marked was June 10, 2021.

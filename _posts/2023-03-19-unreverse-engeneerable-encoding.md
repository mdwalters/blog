You know binary and base64? While playing around with two Scratch extensions, I managed to make a rather strong encryption algorithm. Take the word UwU in it's encrypted form, for example:
```
YAYQwYeUOYQYAYQY+AYQwYA
```

As you can see, some characters that make up the word UwU, but it's very unnoticable. Here is the Scratch code that encodes it:

That's pretty much it.

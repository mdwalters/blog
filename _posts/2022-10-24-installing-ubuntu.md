"Wow," you might be saying, "M.D. created a blog post the day after he made a blog post? Impossible!" Well, I'm going to be doing something my school (board) won't like... Installing another OS on one of thier laptops.



Let's start from the beginning, shall we? I copied the Ubuntu 22.10 ISO contents to my trusty USB, and restarted my laptop. I then pressed F12 many times to get to the boot menu. Excited, I pressed the down arrow until it highlighted my USB stick, and booted into a Ubuntu live demo.



I clicked on the install button, and did it work? No. Why? Because of some stupid partition error. I then tried again more than a few times, but couldn't get it to succeed.



I then did a OEM install, and YAY, IT WORKED! But it's unbootable. Back to the live demo.



Now, as of writing, I'm in the live demo. And I did a fresh install of Ubuntu. And guess what? It succeeded! The result may be the same as the first time, so I'm not going to get my hopes up on this.



Well, after some trying with Boot Repair, it finally worked!

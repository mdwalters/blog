It was lunch time, and after I finished eating lunch, I hopped onto my trusty HP Chromebook x360 to play some Dolphin Emulator. USING PIRACY APPS AT SCHOOL BAD!



I then launched the Wii Menu, and it wasn't that interesting to look at, because there were no channels, and no channels is the equivalent to the most boring game console ever.



I'm not trying to say that the Wii is boring, but a Wii _without_ channels is boring.



One person right beside me asked me if I was playing on Dolphin, and I said yes, and watched me randomly go into the Disc Channel.



Then I closed out of it, because, like I said, a Wii without channels is boring.

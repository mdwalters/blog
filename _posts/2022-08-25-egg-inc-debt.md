If you haven't known already, I play Egg, Inc. It's a good game, but not really anymore to me. Egg, Inc. wants me to pay 135 trillion for upgrading **every** shipping depot, making me in debt :skull:.



I'm currently trying to mitigate this by increasing the fleet size via, you guessed it, research. You'd might be thinking, why am I trying to solve this problem with the thing that started it. It's because it includes... Stuff to get me out of this mess.

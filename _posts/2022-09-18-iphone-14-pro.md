It's new iPhone release time! And in this release, we have something on the screen called Dynamic Island. I think it's a fitting name, as the iPhone uses it for notfitications, and stuff.



Apple describes the new iPhone on it's website as "A magical new way to interact with iPhone", it seems magical, but it isn't. However Apple designed the new iPhone's page really well, +1 to them on that!



It comes with 4 colours: Deep Purple, gold, silver, and space black. Cool.



It also has a Always On Display, I smell AMOLED! And some other features, I think I should let Apple describe.

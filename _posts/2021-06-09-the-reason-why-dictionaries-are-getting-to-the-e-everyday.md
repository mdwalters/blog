It’s not our fault why we don’t know every word. That’s why one clever person made the dictionary! Now your vocabulary will expand! Is this the case? Sort of. Now, that we have the technology, we had been slacking off. How? By not learning new words, and making machines spool out the correct spelling, let’s just say, you’re stuck with the dictionary. Then again, we have the technology, or to word that differently, we have the internet, where we could search up to sites, and catch up on the latest M.D. Walters Medium stories! Since I introduced you to the internet like I was in the '90s, you can use your favourite search engine for this by typing define, with the word you always wanted to know about. Now, the moment we’ve all been waiting for… We have electronic dictionaries! Merriam-Webster joined in on this and so did whoever operates dictionary.com. It is convenient to have it on the web, though!

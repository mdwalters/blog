I was borrowing my sister's phone alot this week, and her response, wasn't too good.


She set a pattern lock on her phone, and tried to unlock it... Wrong pattern. She tried again... Still wrong.



She handed it over to me to help, and told me what she remembered, wasn't it. I sat down on the couch trying to figure it out.



The times I tried increased by alot. I was starting to lose hope in figuring out, and just assumed she did the hardest pattern to remember.



But then, a factory reset was her only choice. I restarted into the phone's BIOS, and asked my sister for consent if she wants me to reset her phone.



It then reset, a little bit more faster than the GUI tool in settings from my experience with the BIOS.




I saw some interesting options on the main BIOS menu, so I decided to check it out a little bit.




The option that catched my eye was the `Run Graphics Test` option, so I clicked on the option (yes, I did say clicked, because you need physical keys to operate it, maybe one day, Android will get a UEFI-like feature). It then did a test, which wasn't really like a test, but then it kicked me back into the main menu.



I restarted the phone, and gave it to my sister, and she lived happily ever after, the end.

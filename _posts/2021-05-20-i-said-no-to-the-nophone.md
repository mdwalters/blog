The NoPhone. The technological marvel… Scratch that, the non-technological marvel which is so bad, was unsuccessful in Shark Tank. Just look at this review from TIME:

Pretty negative, huh? Not as negative as this:

NoPhone just seems a little inspired and uninspired at the same time. One thing the NoPhone Air (which is that the packaging is inflated with air).


Now, take a look at their specs:

Not a lot, huh?

## What to expect from the NoPhone?
Nothing. It’s just a block of plastic moulded together. The only thing it’s good at is being toileted resistant.

## What is it not good at?
Everything. As I said before, It’s just a block of plastic moulded together.

## Is the NoPhone Air air?
Yes, the packaging is full of air, the folks at NoPhone LLC had to only show the packaging.

## Ooh! The NoPhone Selfie! But it does not take selfies.
That’s the whole point! It does not take selfies. It’s just a mirror on the quote-unquote, “screen.”

## Is the company uninspired?
No. It’s what Van Gould would say:

> NoPhone simulates the exact weight and dimensions of your most beloved gadget in order to alleviate any feelings of inadequacy generated by the absence of a real smartphone.

So, the company is inspired by being addicted to smartphones. This company is actually helping you!
